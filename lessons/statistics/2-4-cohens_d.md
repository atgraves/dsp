[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

```python
CohenEffectSize(firsts['totalwgt_lb'], others['totalwgt_lb']), CohenEffectSize(firsts['prglngth'], others['prglngth'])
```

First babies are slightly lighter than others (Cohen's d = -0.089), and first babies arrive slightly later than others (Cohen's d = 0.029).
